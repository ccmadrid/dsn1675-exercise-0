    The usually deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a
    cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and
    shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.
    Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, “Battlestar Galactica.”
    — Jim Halpert
    I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will
    clean them out of their beets.
